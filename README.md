Hey there,

This is a local multiplayer Battleship game, developed as a college project for a course called "Computing Lab." The project was developed in C and is a CLI game where you compete with another PC on the local network by entering the IP address. There is also a mode where an algorithm plays for you. The reason for this is that the class instructor wanted to see which student could develop the best algorithm to play the game.
This was a perfect project to understand a low-level language like C and a great challenge for my computing skills.
The actual code is being refactored because there was a limited amount of time to develop the solution for this project. To make the code as clear as it deserves and showcase it to the world in its best possible state, I decided to work on it again. I hope you enjoy it. See you!
